`ClapTrap Custom constructor called
ScavTrap Custom constructor called
The order of creation of the two class begin from ClapTrap (The base class), to ScavTrap (Child or derived class), this is logic OK, since we need the model first then inherent it to build the customized model (great example hhh)

in the other hand:
ScavTrap Destructor called
ClapTrap Destructor called

the order of desctruction is rversed, i tink due to we have the big model i created first and thy have his derived and child model that inherent his base componenet so by logic the desruction proccess must begin from deeper level to the top level in this case the derived class must be destroyed with his members, then go back to destroy the parent model or class,
sice this explanation is more like talking, and can you correct it
also im want to know the realtion between the base and dereved class how it represented in graphe and in memory and how each class is stored in memory like his mmory layout and his member and function instruction, and how the process access them etc`

# Answer

Great observations ðŸ‘Œ You're thinking exactly in the right way! Letâ€™s clear it up step by step:

ðŸ”¹ Why constructors go Base â†’ Derived, but destructors go Derived â†’ Base?

You said it well with your "big model â†’ customized model" analogy ðŸ˜„

Construction order:

The base class (ClapTrap) must exist first because the derived class (ScavTrap) is built on top of it.

If ClapTrap werenâ€™t constructed yet, ScavTrap would have no foundation.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s why ClapTrap constructor is called first, then ScavTrap.

Destruction order:

The derived part (ScavTrap) must be destroyed first because it may rely on the base class members.

Once the derived part is cleaned, the base class (ClapTrap) can safely be destroyed.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s why the order is reversed: ScavTrap destructor runs first, then ClapTrap.

So your intuition was correct âœ…

ðŸ”¹ How Base & Derived are related in memory layout

Think of a derived class like a struct that starts with its base part:
ScavTrap object in memory:
+-----------------------------+
| ClapTrap::_name             |
| ClapTrap::_hitPoints        |
| ClapTrap::_energyPoints     |
| ClapTrap::_attackDamage     |
+-----------------------------+
| ScavTrap::_guardMode        |   <-- extra member from ScavTrap
+-----------------------------+

    The base class subobject (ClapTrap) is literally embedded at the start of ScavTrap.

    Then the derived class adds its own members afterwards.

So sizeof(ScavTrap) >= sizeof(ClapTrap) always.
ðŸ”¹ Relationship in a graph view

Inheritance looks like this:

       ClapTrap
          â†‘
       ScavTrap

    Arrows point from derived â†’ base (meaning "is-a").

    In construction: graph traversal goes up first (base), then down to derived.

    In destruction: the traversal goes reverse.

ðŸ”¹ How functions are handled in memory (virtual vs non-virtual)

    Non-virtual functions:

        Each class just has its own copy of instructions.

        When you call attack() on a ScavTrap, the compiler resolves it at compile-time if itâ€™s not virtual.

    Virtual functions:

        Classes store a vtable pointer (hidden member, usually at the beginning).

        This table holds addresses of functions.

        When you call attack() on a ClapTrap* that actually points to a ScavTrap, the program looks up the correct function in the vtable â†’ runtime polymorphism.

ðŸ”¹ How the program accesses members

When you do:

scav._hitPoints = 100;

    Compiler knows _hitPoints offset inside ClapTrap.

    Since ClapTrap lives at the start of ScavTrap, the offset is the same.

    So it just accesses (&scav + offset_of_hitPoints) in memory.

For derived members (like _guardMode), itâ€™s just at a later offset.

âœ… So in summary:

    Constructors: Base â†’ Derived

    Destructors: Derived â†’ Base

    Memory layout: Base class stored inside derived object, at the start.

    Functions: either static offsets (non-virtual) or vtable lookup (virtual).
